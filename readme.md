#Integration of Devcontainer in vscodium / Fedora 42 
https://containers.dev/

>DevContainers are isolated development environments that run in clean containers, avoiding conflicts with other builds or system dependencies. They are easy to reproduce and provide a stable base for CI/CD pipelines. By mounting local workspaces, they enable remote development without bloating its own system.
